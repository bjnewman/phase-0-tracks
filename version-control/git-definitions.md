# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that allows us to view a history of changes to one or more files and to control and manage changes to those files by multiple programmers. It is useful because it protects software so that if a bug is discovered it is easy to roll back to a previous version of the code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch creates a copy of a codebase that is intended to allow a coder to experiment with changes, such as adding a feature, without breaking the functioning original copy of the code that remains in the master branch. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit creates a local save point in Git, that Git tracks through the magic of the .git file in each repository. A good commit message describes the changes made to the branch since the previous commit and is readable to others working on the project.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when different changes are made to the same file on two different branches and then merged.
