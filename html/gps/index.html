      <aside><h6>Reflection</h6>
        <p>I think that the purpose of semantic tags is to allow developers to create connections between elements, and to allow different types of connections that provide different and meaningful ways to organize and highlight those connections to the user. For me the most immediately useful tags are main, article, section which create an outline structure for page content.</p>
        <p>
        <p>The browser displays elements on the page according to the outline model so that each root element is displayed and then its child elements are displayed and further nested elements follow.</p>
        <p>I learned that it is relatively straightforward to create keyboard shortcuts for Sublime but this sadly does not extend as easily for the Windows versions. I intent to investigate workarounds to this issue because creating snippets definitely seems useful for setting up defaults for elements like tables and forms.</p>
        <p>I think the most challenging concept in this challenge is beginning to understand the types of possible metadata that can go in the head section. I am particularly interested to learn about how this relates to compatability with various browsers and will specifically look into this and share any easily digestible info with my peers.</p>
