Elevator Algorithm:
-Find current floor #
-Find destination floor #
-If destination floor # = current floor
  -Congrats you have arrived!
-Elsif destination > current
  - Find and press upward facing triangle button to summon elevator
-Else destination < current
  - Find and press downward facing triangle to summon elevator.
-Until elevator arrives, wait quietly away from the elevator doors.
-When elevator arrives, wait for current passengers to exit.
-If there are elderly, disabled, or other persons requiring assistance, hold elevator door open.
-Else enter elevator
-If elevator passengers prevent reading and reaching floor numbers
  -Speak at slightly above normal volume "please press [destination floor #], thank you!"
  -Until current floor # equals destination floor #
    -Wait quietly away from elevator doors and don't start any trouble
  -Once current floor # = destination floor #
    -Speak again at slightly above normal volume "this is my floor, excuse me please"
    -If path is clear to exit elevator
      -continue to destination
    -Elsif repeat "this is my floor excuse me please"
        -If path is clear
          -Proceed to destination
        -Else speak at low volume "out of my way meatbags"
          -Proceed at low speed to destination
          -Ignore usual obstacle rules
-Else proceed to examine elevator buttons.
-With [destination floor #] containing digits [d1,d2,d3]
  -If d1 = 0
    -Proceed to two-digit analysis
  -Else find all elevator buttons with integers [x1,x2,x3] where x1 = d1
    -From set of buttons where x1 = d1 select only buttons where x2 = d2
    -From set of buttons where x1 = d1 and x2 = d2 select button where x3 = d3 and push button until lit or moderate force no longer produces button motion.
-With [destination floor #] containing digits [0, d2, d3]
  -If d2 = 0 
    -proceed to single digit analysis
  -Else find all elevator buttons with integers [0, x2, x3] where x2 = d2
    -From set of buttons where x2 = d2 select button where x3 = d3 and push button until lit or moderate force no longer produces button motion. 
With destination floor # containing digits [0, 0, d3]
  -If d3 = 0
    -Find all buttons with strings "B, L, LL, G, B1"
    -Search for button with integer 1
      - If button 1 exists press only one button with matching string in this order
        - [L,G,LL,B]
      - Else press only one button with matching string in this order
        - [G,LL,B,B1,L]
  Elsif d3 = 1
    -Search for button with integer 1
      - If button 1 exists press it
      - Else press only one button with matching string in this order
        - [L,G,LL,B]
  Elsif d3 < 0
    -Find all buttons of form B[y] where y is an integer
      -from set of buttons select button where y = |d3| and press it.
  Else find all buttons with digits [0,0,d3]
    - compare each button [d3] to destination floor # until d3 = destination #
    - press button
  -Until current floor # equals destination floor #
    -Wait quietly away from elevator doors and don't start any trouble
  -Once current floor # = destination floor #
    -Speak again at slightly above normal volume "this is my floor, excuse me please"
    -If path is clear to exit elevator
      -continue to destination
    -Else repeat x2 "this is my floor excuse me please"
        -If path is clear
          -Proceed to destination
        -Else speak at low volume "out of my way meatbags"
          -Proceed at low speed to destination
          -Ignore usual obstacle rules

Make frozen pizza

-Enter kitchen
  -proceed north 3ft and turn 90 degrees right
  -find & press button sequence "Bake", "3", "7", "5", "Start"

  -turn 90 degrees left and proceed 4 ft west
  -find and pull handle on left door until door angle = 90 degrees
  -use arm to grasp and hold box on shelf 2.5ft ahead and 3.5ft height
  -pull box 1ft south and 1ft east
  -close door 
  -move 2ft east, lower box to encounter resistance, then release
  -search all text on box for string "open here"
    -if string match, remove side of box where match occurs
    -else remove box side with lowest area
  -remove items inside box
