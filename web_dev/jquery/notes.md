# Plan

* Go through basic video tutorials and then find examples of cheatsheets and examples to try out as samples in timeboxed project

# Outcome

* I found that looking through video tutorials through Udemy was the best and easiest way to get multiple viewpoints quickly. From that point on it was just a matter of finding a cheatsheet (w3schools was a the best reference) and trying some out.
